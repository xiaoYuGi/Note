        <p>
            Do not go gentle into that good night.<br> 
            Old age should burn and rave at close of day;<br> 
            Rage,rage against the dying of the light.<br> 
            Though wise men at their end know dark is right,<br> 
            Because their words had forked no lightning they.<br> 
            Do not go gentle into that good night.<br> 
            Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright.<br> 
            Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,<br> 
            Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,<br> 
            And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,<br> 
            Do not go gentle into that good night.<br> <br> 
            Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight,<br> 
            Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay.<br> 
            Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br> 
            And you, my father, there on the sad height,<br> 
            Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.<br> 
            Do not go gentle into that good night.<br> 
            Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br>
